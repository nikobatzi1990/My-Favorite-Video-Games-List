# My-Favorite-Video-Games-List

This is a project I created as part of the Code Chrysalis curriculum. For Polyglottal week, 
I independently studied a new language of my own choice; for this project I selected Python along with the Django framework. I made simple a RESTful API that saves my favorite video game titles into my local database. The included input fields are the title, release year, developer, and genre for each game. 

In the future, I would like to improve the frontend, add a list of the current games in the database, and add an individual page for each game. I am also considering adding a comment field where a user could discuss what aspects they enjoyed about the game.

I used the following Django packages:  

[Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)  
[Python Dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)  
[Psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)  
[VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
