# My-Favorite-Video-Games-List

This is a project I created as part of the Code Chrysalis curriculum. For Polyglottal week, 
I independently studied a new language of my own choice; for this project I selected Python along with the framework, Django. I made simple RESTful API that saves my favorite video game titles in my local database. The included input fields are the title, release year, developer, and genre for each game.

I used the following Django packages:  

[Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)  
[Python Dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)  
[Psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)  
[VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
